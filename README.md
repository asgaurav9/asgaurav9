To ensure the reliability of the application container, a health check has been implemented using Docker's HEALTHCHECK instruction. This health check monitors the health of the container by running a curl command to test if the application is responsive at http://localhost:3000/. If the service is unreachable or returns an error, the container is marked as unhealthy. Docker will retry the check a few times before considering the container as unhealthy. Additionally, the container is configured to restart automatically using the restart: always policy in Docker Compose. This setup ensures that if the container fails, it will be restarted without manual intervention. This health check mechanism improves container reliability, especially in production environments.
